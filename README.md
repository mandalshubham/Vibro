This app is an attempt to analyze the frequency response from iPhone's Accelerometer data.

A tone is played based on the frequency response. Higher the frequency, more the sound. The minimum frequency for the sound is set to 200Hz for experimental purposes. The FFT is applied to every 50 frames of the sample data from accelerometer.
